        <p>Verse: <br>
            Fatal, this attraction,<br>
            Yeah, we might just end up crashin'<br>
            But I'm ready if it happens with you<br>
            Meet me out in Cali<br>
            When I'm far away from family<br>
            And I need someone to hold onto<br>
            <br>
            You're the only thing I know<br>
            And I don't wanna let this go<br>
            Close to you I feelâ€”feel like I'm at home<br>
            Can't wait 'til we're alone<br>
            <br>
            We were built to last<br>
            We were built like that<br>
            Baby, take my hand<br>
            Dive in this romance<br>
            We could burn and crash<br>
            We could take a chance<br>
            Holdin' nothin' back<br>
            Like it's our last dance<br>
            <br>
            Ref: <br> Like it's our last dance<br>
            Like it's our last dance<br>
            Like it's our last dance<br>
            Like it's our last dance<br>
