    <p>Rain, rain, rain, rain <br>
        I catch a groove like, uh-uh
        
        <br> <br>[Chorus]
        Dua Lipa, I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature (Do it) <br>
        I checked the web, they out here chewin' me up, fuck it <br>
        Fadeaway, I lift that Luka knee up, bucket <br>
        I heard from someone you said you could be us, nothing <br>
        
       <br> [Post-Chorus]
        You know my city like the new Korea, bustin' <br>
        All these discussions over who could see us, hush it <br>
        I sold them basements out, let's do arenas, crushin' <br>
        She looking, I'm blushing, I'm lying, I'm touching
        
        </p>
